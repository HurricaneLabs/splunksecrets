splunksecrets - Encrypt and Decrypt Splunk Passwords
====================================================

|Build Status| |codecov.io|

``splunksecrets`` is a tool for working with Splunk secrets offline. It
currently supports encryption and decryption of passwords, but in the
future will support offline recursive conversion of a Splunk
installation from one splunk.secret file to another (e.g. for
synchronizing splunk.secret across your entire distributed
infrastructure).

Installation
------------

``splunksecrets`` can be installed using pip3:

::

   pip3 install splunksecrets

Or, if you're feeling adventurous, can be installed directly from
github:

::

   pip3 install git+https://github.com/HurricaneLabs/splunksecrets.git

Usage
-----

As of version 1.0.0, splunksecrets is broken into subcommands for each
operaton

::

  Usage: splunksecrets [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Options:
    --help  Show this message and exit.

  Commands:
    dbconnect-decrypt      Decrypt password used for dbconnect identity
    dbconnect-encrypt      Encrypt password used for dbconnect identity
    phantom-decrypt        Decrypt password used for Phantom asset
    phantom-encrypt        Encrypt password used for Phantom asset
    splunk-decrypt         Decrypt password using Splunk 7.2 algorithm
    splunk-encrypt         Encrypt password using Splunk 7.2 algorithm
    splunk-hash-passwd     Generate password hash for use in...
    splunk-legacy-decrypt  Decrypt password using legacy Splunk algorithm...
    splunk-legacy-encrypt  Encrypt password using legacy Splunk algorithm...

You can find details of the usage of each subcommand by running the command
followed by ``--help``.

- **dbconnect-encrypt** and **dbconnect-decrypt** are for interacting with
  credentials stored in ``identities.conf`` in splunk_app_db_connect
- **phantom-encrypt** and **phantom-decrypt** are for interacting with
  credentials stored in the Phantom database
- **splunk-encrypt** and **splunk-decrypt** are for interacting with
  credentials from Splunk 7.2 or newer
- **splunk-legacy-encrypt** and **splunk-legacy-decrypt** are for interacting
  with credentials from Splunk versions below 7.2
- **splunk-hash-passwd** is for generating Splunk local user password hashes
  for use in ``$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd``

Encryption Schemes
------------------

Splunk passwd hashes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Splunk password hashes are not, strictly speaking, encrypted. They're
hashed using the standard Unix ``crypt`` function. The ``$6$`` indicates
that SHA-512 hashing algorithm is used. Details on SHA-crypt can be
found `here <https://akkadia.org/drepper/SHA-crypt.txt>`__.

Splunk pre-7.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Splunk prior to 7.2 used RC4 encryption for secrets, indicated in
configuration files by ``$1$`` in the encrypted password. The plaintext
password is XOR'ed with a static salt (``DEFAULTSA``) and then RC4
encrypted using the first 16-bytes of ``splunk.secret`` as the key. The
resulting ciphertext is base64-encoded and prepended with ``$1$`` to
produce the encrypted password seen in the configuration files.

Splunk 7.2
~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in Splunk 7.2, AES256-GCM is used for encryption of secrets,
indicated in configuration files by ``$7$`` in the encrypted password.
The ``PBKDF2`` algorithm is used to derive an encryption key from all
254 bytes of ``splunk.secret`` (the newline character is stripped from
the end of the file), using a static salt of ``disk-encryption`` and a
single iteration. This 256-bit key is then used as the encryption key
for AES256-GCM, with a 16-byte randomly generated initialization vector.
The encryption produces both the ciphertext as well as a "tag" that is
used as part of integrity verification. The iv, ciphertext, and tag (in
that order) are concatenated, base64-encoded, and prepended with ``$7$``
to produce the encrypted password seen in the configuration files.

Phantom
~~~~~~~

Phantom stores encrypted credentials in it's internal database as part
of the JSON blob in the ``configuration`` column of the asset table.
These credentials are encrypted using AES256-CBC and are stored
base64-encoded. A SHA256 hash is generated using the public modulus of
the Phantom RSA private key (located at
``/opt/phantom/keystore/private_key.pem``) concatenated with the
Django ``SECRET_KEY`` (found in
``/opt/phantom/www/phantom_ui/secret_key.py``) - this hash is used as
the key for the AES encryption. A SHA1 hash is generated using the
``id`` of the asset from the ``asset`` table - this hash is used as
the initialization vector (``iv``) for the AES encryption. The password
to be encrypted is padded using PKCS7 padding prior to encryption.

DBConnect
~~~~~~~~~

DBConnect encrypts passwords using the OpenSSL ``aes-256-cbc`` command.
This encryption is fairly straightforward, and is documented in
``dbxcrypto.py`` included with DBConnect. The key and IV are derived from
the secret (stored in ``$SPLUNK_HOMEetc/apps/splunk_app_db_connect/certs/identity.dat``)
and the salt (randomly generated by OpenSSL). The resulting ciphertext is
concatenated together with the salt (``Salted__`` + salt + ciphertext) and
encoded using Base64. The password to be encrypted is padded using PKCS7
padding prior to encryption.

Known Issues
------------

- If the splunk secret and an encrypted password don't match, one of
  two things will happen - either you'll get gibberish output, or a
  Python traceback. At some point, we'll hopefully have better error
  checking for this.
- DBConnect will occassionally store the ending newline from OpenSSL output in
  identities.conf, represented as a single ``\`` at the end of a line. This
  must be removed prior to passing encrypted passwords to ``splunksecrets``

Version History
---------------


Version 1.0.0rc3 (2021-06-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Updated CLI command docstrings for proper help output
- Add initial support for encryption/decrypt of Splunk DBConnect credentials

Version 1.0.0rc1 (2021-05-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New CLI interface that breaks each operation into its own subcommand
- CLI interface supports passing path to key files (splunk.secret,
  private_key.pem, and secret_key.py) via arguments, or file contents
  via environment variables
- Add initial support for encryption/decryption of Phantom asset
  credentials (thanks swoops)

Version 0.5.1 (2022-06-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Allow passing the splunk secret itself as an environment variable 
    ~ provided by chutzimir 


Version 0.5.0 (2020-06-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  contents, and the password/password hash via environment variables

- Added error output when trying to decrypt user passwords

Version 0.4.3 (2020-02-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Correct an issue when splunk secret is too long. Splunk handles this
  by truncating splunk.secret to 254 bytes, so we now do the same
  (thanks nbertram)
- Added error checking in case, somehow, splunk secret is too short.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add handling for incorrectly padded (but otherwise correct) password
  strings as a convenience (thanks rafrey-his)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix an issue in Python 3 when using ``--splunk-secret-text`` (thanks
  Joeboyc2)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``--hash-passwd`` flag for generating Splunk password hashes

Version 0.3.1 (2019-02-06)

  character
- Add ``--splunk-secret-text`` and ``--password`` arguments for
  non-interactive use (thanks nadidsky)

Version 0.3.0 (2019-01-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``--nosalt`` flag for pre-7.2 passwords that are not salted, such
  as ``sslPassword`` (thanks duckfez)

Version 0.2.1 (2018-10-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Cosmetic release to update metadata on PyPI
