splunksecrets - Encrypt and Decrypt Splunk Passwords
====================================================

|Build Status| |codecov.io|

``splunksecrets`` is a tool for working with Splunk secrets offline. It
currently supports encryption and decryption of passwords, but in the
future will support offline recursive conversion of a Splunk
installation from one splunk.secret file to another (e.g. for
synchronizing splunk.secret across your entire distributed
infrastructure).

Installation
------------

``splunksecrets`` can be installed using pip3:

::

   pip3 install splunksecrets

Or, if you're feeling adventurous, can be installed directly from
github:

::

   pip3 install git+https://github.com/HurricaneLabs/splunksecrets.git

Usage
-----

::

   usage: splunksecrets [-h] [--splunk-secret SPLUNK_SECRET]
                    [--splunk-secret-text SPLUNK_SECRET_TEXT] [-D] [--new]
                    [--nosalt] [--password PASSWORD]

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --splunk-secret SPLUNK_SECRET
     --splunk-secret-text SPLUNK_SECRET_TEXT
     -D, --decrypt
     -H, --hash-passwd
     --new
     --nosalt
     --password PASSWORD

- Use ``--new`` when encrypting/decrypting Splunk 7.2 secrets
  (indicated by ``$7$``)
- Use ``--nosalt`` when encrypting/decrypting Splunk pre-7.2 secrets that are
  not hashed
- Use ``--splunk-secret`` to specify a path to splunk.secret, or use the
  ``SPLUNK_SECRET`` environment variable
- Use ``--splunk-secret-text`` to specify ``splunk.secret`` contents on the
  command line, or use the ``SPLUNK_SECRET_TEXT`` environment variable
- Use ``--password`` to specify password to be encrypted/decrypted on the
  command line, or use the ``PASSWORD`` environment variable

  - NOTE: when doing so, on \*nix or other platforms running bash-like
    shells, you must escape the ``$`` in passwords, like so:

    ::

        splunksecrets --splunk-secret-text ... --password \$1\$.....

- Use ``--hash-password`` to generate a hash for $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd

Encryption Schemes
------------------

Splunk passwd hashes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Splunk password hashes are not, strictly speaking, encrypted. They're
hashed using the standard Unix ``crypt`` function. The ``$6$`` indicates
that SHA-512 hashing algorithm is used. Details on SHA-crypt can be
found `here <https://akkadia.org/drepper/SHA-crypt.txt>`__.

Splunk pre-7.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Splunk prior to 7.2 used RC4 encryption for secrets, indicated in
configuration files by ``$1$`` in the encrypted password. The plaintext
password is XOR'ed with a static salt (``DEFAULTSA``) and then RC4
encrypted using the first 16-bytes of ``splunk.secret`` as the key. The
resulting ciphertext is base64-encoded and prepended with ``$1$`` to
produce the encrypted password seen in the configuration files.

Splunk 7.2
~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in Splunk 7.2, AES256-GCM is used for encryption of secrets,
indicated in configuration files by ``$7$`` in the encrypted password.
The ``PBKDF2`` algorithm is used to derive an encryption key from all
254 bytes of ``splunk.secret`` (the newline character is stripped from
the end of the file), using a static salt of ``disk-encryption`` and a
single iteration. This 256-bit key is then used as the encryption key
for AES256-GCM, with a 16-byte randomly generated initialization vector.
The encryption produces both the ciphertext as well as a "tag" that is
used as part of integrity verification. The iv, ciphertext, and tag (in
that order) are concatenated, base64-encoded, and prepended with ``$7$``
to produce the encrypted password seen in the configuration files.

Known Issues
------------

- If the splunk secret and an encrypted password don't match, one of
  two things will happen - either you'll get gibberish output, or a
  Python traceback. At some point, we'll hopefully have better error
  checking for this.

Version History
---------------

Version 0.5.0 (2020-06-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add support for passing a path to splunk.secret, the splunk.secret
  contents, and the password/password hash via environment variables
  (thanks hanswurscht)
- Added error output when trying to decrypt user passwords

Version 0.4.3 (2020-02-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Correct an issue when splunk secret is too long. Splunk handles this
  by truncating splunk.secret to 254 bytes, so we now do the same
  (thanks nbertram)
- Added error checking in case, somehow, splunk secret is too short.

Version 0.4.2 (2019-09-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add handling for incorrectly padded (but otherwise correct) password
  strings as a convenience (thanks rafrey-his)

Version 0.4.1 (2019-09-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix an issue in Python 3 when using ``--splunk-secret-text`` (thanks
  Joeboyc2)

Version 0.4.0 (2019-03-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``--hash-passwd`` flag for generating Splunk password hashes

Version 0.3.1 (2019-02-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix bug when a character in the password was the same as the salt
  character
- Add ``--splunk-secret-text`` and ``--password`` arguments for
  non-interactive use (thanks nadidsky)

Version 0.3.0 (2019-01-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``--nosalt`` flag for pre-7.2 passwords that are not salted, such
  as ``sslPassword`` (thanks duckfez)

Version 0.2.1 (2018-10-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Cosmetic release to update metadata on PyPI

Version 0.2.0 (2018-10-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for Splunk 7.2

Version 0.1.0 (2018-10-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial release
- Support Splunk < 7.2
